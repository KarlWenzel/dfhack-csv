# dfhack-csv

To use this script with Dwarf Fortress + DFhack, simply drop this script into the scripts folder for your DFhack install, e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dwarf Fortress\hack\scripts.  You can now run this program with the `csv` command within the DFhack console.

Before you use it, don't forget to set the `save_path` variable to the directory path on your machine that you want to use. You need to use a double `\\` for the backslashes.
